## Hi, I'm Santa, I'm a:
- Computer engineering student at the University of Michigan focusing on embedded systems and offensive security. 
- Assistant Researcher in a Nuclear Engineering Lab focusing on secure ptp file transfer and remote device security.
- Hands-on troubleshooting researcher for a team designing an inexpensive layman-understandable Geiger-MÃ¼ller device from scratch with a team of researchers.
- Assistant Designer to a Navigational Algorithm team focusing on finding lost Electro-magnetic Field Sources.

## Some of what I like to do in my free time is to:
- Modify consumer electronics for unintended uses.
- 3d Design parts for unique use cases.
- Play and modify video games
- Fabricate multimedia recreations of popular film accessories and costumes for demonstration.
